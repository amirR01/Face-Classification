# Face-Classification
**Face Classification by SVM on Eigenfaces**
- The first step is to create Eigenfaces by reducing the dimensions of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and then visualizing them.
- Next, the faces will be classified in the reduced dimension space by using SVM.
- The dataset used in this project is called `olivetti_faces` and is available in the `datasets` library of `sklearn`.
- The `sklearn` library is used for SVM, PCA and other requirements in this project.
